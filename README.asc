= pgerror
This extension adds a few tools to make it easier to handle errors in Postgres

== error_data
This is a compound type that can be passed around or stored in a table. It
contains fields that correspond to every available detail for an exception.

== try()
This function will execute the SQL in the `code` parameter and return the
number of rows affected (NULL on an error), or an `error_data` record if an
error occurred (NULL if no error).
